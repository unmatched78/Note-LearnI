## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please report it privately** via email:

üìß **iradukundavierra4@gmail.com**

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets

We aim to respond to all reports within **72 hours**.

## Scope

This project includes:

- Django REST API (Python)
- React + TypeScript frontend
- Auth via Clerk.dev
- AI integrations (e.g., OpenAI, YouTube Transcript API)

Vulnerabilities related to third-party services (e.g., Clerk, OpenAI) should also be reported through their official channels.

## Security Best Practices We Follow

- ‚úÖ HTTPS enforced for all requests  
- ‚úÖ Rate-limiting + throttling for sensitive endpoints  
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection on all non-API views  
- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication with refresh token support  
- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization  
- ‚úÖ Secure media file handling  
- ‚úÖ File upload limits and extension checks  
- ‚úÖ JSON field access constrained by backend (e.g., avoids `contains` on unsupported DBs)  
- ‚úÖ Frontend: no direct DOM manipulation; strict React/TypeScript usage  
- ‚úÖ Backend: DRF permission classes enforced (e.g., `IsAuthenticated`)  

---

## Areas of High Sensitivity

The following components require extra attention for security:

- Transcription endpoints (e.g., YouTube or audio uploads)
- AI prompt handling (avoid injection attacks)
- User-submitted documents and metadata
- Quiz and flashcard generation logic (ensure no prompt leaking)

---

## Dependencies

We regularly monitor and audit dependencies using:

- `pip-audit` (Python)
- `npm audit` or `pnpm audit` (JavaScript)
